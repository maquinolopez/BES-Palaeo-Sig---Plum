# _Plum_ age-depth modelling.

This is an introduction to age-depth modelling using the R package rplum.

The tutorial is broken up into two sections: an introduction presentation (hosted in the folder "presentation") and an RMarkdown file (hosted in the folder "code") that contains instructions on how to install and use rplum.


The essential files for executing this lesson are located in the _Plum runs_ folder. The user's home folder, which serves as R's working directory, should have a copy of this folder.
